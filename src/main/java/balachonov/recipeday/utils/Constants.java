            Sweet Potato and Chicken Sausage.
                        
            You'll need:
            2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1⁄4" cubes
            1⁄2 Tbsp olive oil
            2 links uncooked chicken sausage (chicken-apple works nicely)
            1 medium yellow onion, chopped
            1 red bell pepper, chopped
            1⁄8 tsp cayenne pepper
            Salt and black pepper to taste
            4 eggs, fried sunny-side up
            Tabasco sauce
                        
            How to make it:
            Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender,
            about 10 minutes. Drain.
            Heat the oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cut open the sausage casing and
            squeeze the meat directly into the pan, discarding the casing. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes, until the meat
            is cooked through. Transfer to a plate.
            In the same pan, add the reserved sweet potatoes, the onion, and red pepper. Cook until the potatoes and
            vegetables are browned, about 7 minutes. Return the sausage to the pan, season with the cayenne and salt
            and pepper, and stir to mix.
            Divide the hash among four plates or bowls. Top each serving with a fried egg and Tabasco.

            2 Tbsp olive oil mayonnaise
            2 Tbsp chopped sun-dried tomatoes
            Juice of 1⁄2 lemon
            2 cloves garlic, finely minced
            1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary
            Salt and black pepper
            1 lb lean ground chicken
            4 whole-wheat or potato buns (or even English muffins), split

            In a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon juice, garlic, and rosemary.

            When the grill or skillet is hot (if using a skillet, add a touch of oil), add the burgers.
            Cook on the first side for 5 to 6 minutes, until a nice crust develops.
            Flip and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the burgers are firm but ever so slightly
            yielding to the touch and cooked through.
            Remove the burgers. While the grill or pan is hot, toast the buns.
            Layer the bottom buns with the arugula, top each with a burger, then slather the aioli over the top of each.
            Crown with the bun tops and serve.
